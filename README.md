# dumlang

kind of a dumb language

## Wat?

`dum` is a silly language I made so that I could write a compiler for it.

## Why?

I wanted to learn how codegen works in practice. I haven't read any books on it yet, but my goal is to try and implement *something* and then improve it so that I can better understand the reasoning behind the best practices.
But my alterior motive is to have some fun figuring out how to make something I have no idea how to make.
